# Handoff

This file is a recovery summary. Truth sources remain `workflow-state.json` and `tasks.json`.

- workflowId: workflow-plan-013-english-harness-artifacts-v1
- planRef: ./plans/active/PLAN-013/plan.md
- activeTaskId: null
- currentPhase: planning
- taskStatus: all tasks idle
- ownerRole: planner
- sourceSessionId: session-070319

## Current Status

PLAN-013 has been created from backlog item BL-007 (`chat:2026-04-29-harness-language-standardization`). The plan package is intended to standardize human-facing `.harness` framework artifacts to English while preserving Harness lifecycle behavior. No task has been activated yet.

## Role Handoff

- fromRole: planner
- toRole: developer
- reason: plan package has been materialized; next lifecycle action is task activation
- stateSource: workflow-state.json and tasks.json

## Risks

- Exact diagnostic tests must be updated with script changes rather than relaxed.
- Validation heuristics and compatibility fixtures must not be accidentally weakened during translation.
- `workflow-state.json` and `tasks.json` writes must stay behind their script gateways.

## Next Action

Activate TASK-001 through the lifecycle transaction gateway.
