# Handoff

This file is a recovery summary. Truth sources remain `workflow-state.json` and `tasks.json`.

- workflowId: workflow-plan-012-v1
- planRef: ./plans/active/PLAN-012/plan.md
- activeTaskId: null
- currentPhase: planning
- taskStatus: all tasks idle
- ownerRole: planner
- sourceSessionId: session-2026-04-28-plan-012

## Current Status

The PLAN-012 package registry release workflow plan has been materialized under `work/plans/active/PLAN-012/`. The plan includes `plan.md`, generated `tasks.json`, and this `handoff.md`. No task has been activated and no implementation work has started.

## Role Handoff

- fromRole: planner
- toRole: developer
- reason: plan package has been materialized; next lifecycle action requires explicit user instruction before task activation
- stateSource: workflow-state.json and tasks.json

## Risks

- Real TestPyPI/PyPI publication requires external registry setup and explicit operator approval; implementation must not publish as a side effect of tests.
- PyPI Trusted Publisher configuration lives outside this repository and must be verified before promotion.
- Keep release tooling outside `.harness/` unless a future task intentionally changes Harness runtime framework architecture.

## Next Action

Wait for user instruction before activating TASK-001.
