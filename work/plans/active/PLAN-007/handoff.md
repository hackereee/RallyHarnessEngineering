# Handoff

This file is a recovery summary. Truth sources remain `workflow-state.json` and `tasks.json`.

- workflowId: workflow-plan-007-v1
- planRef: ./plans/active/PLAN-007/plan.md
- activeTaskId: null
- currentPhase: planning
- taskStatus: all tasks idle
- ownerRole: planner
- sourceSessionId: session-2026-04-27-project-init-onboarding

## Current Status

The plan package has been drafted under `work/plans/active/PLAN-007/`. No task has been activated yet. The next deterministic step is to materialize `tasks.json` from `plan.md`, then start the planned workflow through `start-workflow.py`.

## Role Handoff

- fromRole: planner
- toRole: developer
- reason: plan package is ready for materialization and lifecycle activation
- stateSource: workflow-state.json and tasks.json

## Risks

- Keep skill rename references synchronized across session-start required assets, tests, architecture docs, and skill paths.
- Use a managed block for project entrypoint updates so existing user rules are not overwritten.
- Keep root `ARCHITECTURE.md` reserved for business architecture and `.harness/ARCHITECTURE.md` reserved for Harness framework architecture.

## Next Action

Materialize PLAN-007 tasks and start workflow-plan-007-v1.
