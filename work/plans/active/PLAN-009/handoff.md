# Handoff

This file is a recovery summary. Truth sources remain `workflow-state.json` and `tasks.json`.

- workflowId: workflow-plan-009-v1
- planRef: ./plans/active/PLAN-009/plan.md
- activeTaskId: null
- currentPhase: planning
- taskStatus: all tasks idle
- ownerRole: planner
- sourceSessionId: session-2026-04-28-plan-009

## Current Status

The PLAN-009 draft has passed the planning-time review gate and is being materialized as an active L2/L3 plan package. No task has been activated yet.

## Role Handoff

- fromRole: planner
- toRole: developer
- reason: plan package is ready for lifecycle activation after `tasks.json` materialization
- stateSource: workflow-state.json and tasks.json

## Risks

- Keep semantic workflow conflict review in the Agent-facing `project-init` skill; do not move it into deterministic entrypoint parsing.
- Keep generated target entrypoint prose concise enough to avoid copying this repository's full `AGENTS.md`.
- Keep `workflow-state.json` writes behind `state-write.py` and task writes behind `materialize-tasks.py` or `update-task.py`.

## Next Action

Activate the first eligible idle task through `lifecycle-transaction.py activate-next`.
