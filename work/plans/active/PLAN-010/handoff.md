# Handoff

This file is a recovery summary. Truth sources remain `workflow-state.json` and `tasks.json`.

- workflowId: workflow-plan-010-v1
- planRef: ./plans/active/PLAN-010/plan.md
- activeTaskId: null
- currentPhase: planning
- taskStatus: all tasks idle
- ownerRole: planner
- sourceSessionId: session-2026-04-28-plan-010

## Current Status

The PLAN-010 package has been materialized from the approved backlog consumption design. `plan.md`, `tasks.json`, and this `handoff.md` are present under `work/plans/active/PLAN-010/`. No task has been activated yet.

## Role Handoff

- fromRole: planner
- toRole: developer
- reason: plan package is ready for lifecycle activation after `tasks.json` materialization
- stateSource: workflow-state.json and tasks.json

## Risks

- Keep `backlogs.json` as a pending queue only; consumed item history belongs in `consumed.jsonl`.
- Keep `nextId` required so consumed item deletion cannot cause ID reuse.
- Keep backlog scripts from writing workflow or task execution state.
- Block consumption unless downstream plan or workflow artifacts reference the backlog id or `sourceRef`.

## Next Action

Activate the first eligible idle task through `lifecycle-transaction.py activate-next`.
