# Plan Writing

## Overview

Produce a complete Harness active plan package for L2/L3 work:

```text
work/plans/active/<PLAN-ID>/
├─ plan.md
├─ tasks.json
└─ handoff.md
```

`plan.md` is the planning truth source, `tasks.json` is the task execution truth source, and `handoff.md` is only a recovery summary. Plan writing includes a planning-time `Plan Review Gate`; `tasks.json` materialization happens only after that gate has `Status: passed`. Plan writing stops before task activation.

## Read First

Read these before creating or revising a plan package:

- `harness-design/architecture.md`
- `harness-design/task-level.md`
- `.harness/rules/workflow-lifecycle.md`
- `learning-notes/scripts-vs-llm.md`
- `learning-notes/tasks-workflow-gates.md`
- `.harness/schemas/tasks.schema.json`
- `.harness/templates/plan.template.md`
- `.harness/templates/tasks.template.json`
- `.harness/templates/handoff.template.md`

## When to Use

Use this skill for:

- Turning a requirement, backlog item, or approved design into an L2/L3 Harness plan.
- Revising an active Harness plan and rematerializing `tasks.json`.
- Materializing an already reviewed `plan.md` task contract into `tasks.json` and `handoff.md`.

Do not use this skill for:

- L0/L1 direct work.
- Executing an existing task.
- Activating the next task.
- Workflow testing, task reviewing, or archiving a plan.

If the work is L0/L1, do not create `work/plans/active/<PLAN-ID>/`.

## Script Boundary

Use `.harness/scripts/materialize-tasks.py` for deterministic extraction and validation:

```bash
python3 .harness/scripts/materialize-tasks.py work/plans/active/<PLAN-ID>/plan.md --out work/plans/active/<PLAN-ID>/tasks.json --schema .harness/schemas/tasks.schema.json
```

Only call it after `plan.md` contains confirmed structured task contracts and a passed planning-time review gate. The script:

- Requires `## Plan Review Gate` with `Status: passed`.
- Parses anchor-backed task contract sections.
- Writes only `tasks.json`.
- Validates `tasks.schema.json`, `taskId`, `planSection`, `dependsOn`, file boundaries, acceptance, and verification.
- Leaves every task `status = "idle"` and `ownerRole = "developer"`.

It does not judge requirement scope, invent tasks from free text, activate tasks, update verification results, or write `workflow-state.json`.

## Templates

Harness artifact templates belong under `.harness/templates/`, not inside this skill.

- Use `.harness/templates/plan.template.md` for the required plan structure and parseable task contract syntax.
- Use `.harness/templates/handoff.template.md` for the recovery summary shape.
- Use `.harness/templates/tasks.template.json` only as the schema-valid task manifest sample; do not hand-write active `tasks.json` from it.

Skill-local files are only for skill instructions or large examples, not Harness artifact contracts.

## Flow

### 1. Pre-write Confirmation

Classify the work:

- L0/L1: no plan package.
- L2: one active plan package.
- L3: split into sequential phase plans unless one active plan can produce an independently verifiable result.

Ask only blocking questions. Blocking uncertainty includes unclear scope, unclear file boundaries, unverifiable acceptance, missing verification, uncertain task dependencies, or an L2/L3 classification dispute.

Before writing files, give a concise write summary:

- `planId` and target path.
- Task level.
- Scope and non-scope.
- File boundaries.
- Task list with dependencies, acceptance, and verification.
- Expected Architecture Impact for target project architecture and Harness framework architecture.
- Risks and open questions.
- Statement that the next step is the planning-time Plan Review Gate, not task activation.

Continue only after the summary is confirmed or the existing `plan.md` has already passed Plan Review Gate.

### 2. Plan Review Gate

Review the plan before running `materialize-tasks.py`. This review is a planning gate, not `workflow-state.currentPhase=reviewing`, and it must never be modeled as a task.

The review must check:

- Scope and non-scope are explicit enough to prevent task drift.
- File boundaries are concrete and match the intended ownership.
- Dependencies are acyclic and only reference delivery tasks.
- Acceptance criteria are observable.
- Verification commands or checks are reproducible.
- Architecture Impact distinguishes target project architecture from Harness framework architecture.
- Testing and review remain workflow gates, not standalone tasks.
- The plan does not require direct writes to `workflow-state.json` or hand-authored `tasks.json`.

If the review fails, revise `plan.md` and repeat this gate. If it passes, record the result in `plan.md` before running `materialize-tasks.py`:

```md
## Plan Review Gate

Status: passed
Reviewer: <agent-or-human-reviewer>
Reviewed At: <ISO-8601 timestamp>

Checks:
- Scope, file boundaries, task dependencies, acceptance, and verification are reviewable.
- Architecture Impact is recorded as a gate, not a standalone task.
- Testing and review remain workflow gates, not standalone tasks.

Findings:
- No blocking findings.
```

### 3. Atomic Materialization

Write the active package as a unit:

1. Ensure there is no conflicting active plan directory.
2. Create `work/plans/active/<PLAN-ID>/`.
3. Write `plan.md` using `.harness/templates/plan.template.md` structure, including `Plan Review Gate` with `Status: passed`.
4. Run `materialize-tasks.py` to generate `tasks.json`.
5. Write `handoff.md` using `.harness/templates/handoff.template.md` shape.

Hard rules:

- Do not leave only `plan.md` under `work/plans/active/<PLAN-ID>/`.
- Do not run `materialize-tasks.py` until `plan.md` contains `Plan Review Gate` with `Status: passed`.
- Do not hand-write `tasks.json` when `materialize-tasks.py` can parse the plan.
- Do not create checkbox execution state in `plan.md`.
- Keep the task contract section at the end of `plan.md`; the current materializer reads task bodies until the next task anchor.
- Do not hand-write task review outcomes during plan writing; `materialize-tasks.py` initializes each task `review.lastResult = "not_run"`.
- Do not activate the first task.
- Do not write `workflow-state.json` directly.

### 4. Post-write Validation

Run the materialization command and relevant template/schema tests. At minimum, verify:

- `plan.md` contains `## Plan Review Gate` and `Status: passed`.
- `plan.md` contains `## Architecture Impact` and names target project architecture and Harness framework architecture impact.
- `tasks.json` is valid JSON and passes `.harness/schemas/tasks.schema.json`.
- Every `taskId` is unique.
- Every `planSection` points to an anchor in `plan.md`.
- Every `dependsOn` references an existing task.
- Every task has file boundaries, acceptance, and verification commands or checks.
- Every task is initially `idle`.
- Every task has `review.lastResult = "not_run"` and `review.threshold = 85`.
- `handoff.md` describes planning/pre-activation state, not an active task.

## Plan Contract Rules

Each task contract in `plan.md` must follow this parseable shape:

```md
<a id="task-001-descriptive-anchor"></a>

### TASK-001: Descriptive title

Goal: One concrete delivery goal.

Files:
- Create: `exact/path`
- Modify: `exact/path`
- Test: `exact/path`

Depends on: []

Acceptance:
- Concrete acceptance statement.

Verification:
- Run: `exact command`
- Check: concrete manual or structural check.
```

Task contracts must not include `TBD`, `TODO`, vague work such as "完善逻辑", missing paths, or generic verification such as "manual test passed".

## Lifecycle Boundary

Task activation belongs to `.harness/rules/workflow-lifecycle.md`.

After plan writing:

- `tasks.json` contains only idle tasks, with verification and review gates both initialized to `not_run`.
- `workflow-state.activeTaskId` remains `null` until lifecycle activation.
- `workflow-state.currentPhase` remains `planning` until lifecycle activation.
- The suggested next action is to run lifecycle activation through `.harness/scripts/lifecycle-transaction.py activate-next`, which coordinates `select-next-task.py`, `update-task.py`, `state-write.py`, and `handoff.md`.
- Do not run `select-next-task.py` as a substitute for materialization validation, and do not apply its suggested updates from plan-writing.

Testing and review are workflow gates. Never create separate tasks whose only purpose is "test" or "review".
Architecture Impact is also a workflow gate. Never create a separate task whose only purpose is "decide whether architecture changed"; create a task only when updating architecture documentation is a concrete deliverable.

## Self-Review

Before claiming the package is ready, check:

- L0/L1 did not create a plan package.
- L2/L3 produced `plan.md`, `tasks.json`, and `handoff.md` together.
- There is only one active plan directory.
- Scope, non-scope, files, tasks, dependencies, acceptance, and verification are covered.
- Architecture Impact records expected updates or explicit non-impact for root `ARCHITECTURE.md` and Harness framework architecture.
- `plan.md` records a passed Plan Review Gate before materialization.
- `plan.md` has stable anchors and no execution checkboxes.
- `tasks.json` has schema-supported `review` fields initialized by the materializer, not hand-authored review results.
- `handoff.md` is a recovery summary and names state truth sources.
- No task is active and `workflow-state.json` was not edited directly.
